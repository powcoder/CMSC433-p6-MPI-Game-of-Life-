If you want to know what you are going to do in the project, please read the
project specification (p6.pdf).

src/: the folder that has all the source (*.c) files.
  There are originally 3 source files.
  1: life_mpi.c: the MPI-parallelized version of Game of Life.
  2: life_seq.c: the sequential version of Game of Life.
  3: sample_mpi.c: the sample MPI program.

run/: the folder in which you want to compile and run the C programs.
  There is 1 host file.
  1: hostfile: the custom MPI configuration file.
  
  There is 1 MPI installation script.
  1: install_mpi.sh: the script installs OpenMPI with apt-get.
     You will be prompted for your password during the installation process.
     (NOTE: The installation script has only been tested on the course VM.)
  
  There is 1 make file.
  1: Makefile: the make file of the project.
     The file has an "all" target and a "clean" target.
     The file also has 3 individual targets: life_mpi, life_seq, and sample_mpi.
  
  There are 3 "run" scripts.
  1: run_life_mpi.sh: the script automatically builds and runs life_mpi with the
     command line arguments that you have to provide.
     The output will both be printed on the terminal and saved as *.OUT file.
  2: run_life_seq.sh: the script automatically builds and runs life_seq with the
     command line arguments that you have to provide.
     The output will both be printed on the terminal and saved as *.OUT file.
  3: run_sample_mpi.sh: the script automatically builds and runs sample_mpi with
     the command line arguments that you have to provide.
     The output will both be printed on the terminal and saved as *.OUT file.
  
  There are 4 set of sample input/output data files.
  *.in: the input data files.
        The input files are called life-data_<Number>.in.
  *.out: the output data files.
         The output files are called:
         life-data_<Number>_<Iters>-<X_Limit>-<Y_Limit>.out.
  
  There is 1 "clean" script.
  1: clean_OUT.sh: the script removes all *.OUT files that are automatically
     generated by the "run" scripts.

tools/: the folder that has some very useful tools that can help you in this
        project.
